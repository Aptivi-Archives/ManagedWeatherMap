    "keywords": "What is ManagedWeatherMap? ManagedWeatherMap is a frontend library of OpenWeatherMap that gets information about the weather in a specific city. It can tell you about today's forecast. It was initially bundled with Kernel Simulator as a side project, but we decided to split the methods in it to this library. What is this web page? This webpage is an API documentation for mod developers to be used as reference. It constantly gets updated as we push the updates to the main and servicing versions of this project. If you still intend to use a documentation specific to your preferred version of ManagedWeatherMap, you may refer to the releases page of the project and download the attached <version>-doc.rar file. To get started using the documentation, select API Documentation from the top menu and select a namespace to get a clear overview of the API. Feedback If you wish to leave feedback to us about this API reference website, use the issue tracker of the project. If you wish to contribute to the documentation of the API, go to the project source code and make your improvements there on a draft Pull Request ; we don't support override files that are made by clicking on Improve this doc . Any meaningful contributions are welcome. Copyright (c) 2022 EoflaOE and its companies. All rights reserved."
